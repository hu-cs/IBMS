This project covers all accounting and management aspects of an industrial company that will be produced in two versions.
One of the biggest problems of the industrial companies is accounting and measurement of their profit.
Most of the companies account with notebooks yet; witch it caused of consuming the (time and cost), hiring more employees, lack of certainty on their accounting, profit and etc
But a less amount of companies, use from computer and technology in their accounting, witch they use form basic computer application like Excel. But it can’t be as useful as possible for them; for example if they use from excel for their stock accounting, if any formula is changed by the officer, then something that happens is a disaster.
As I could catch something from interviews, about all companies have problem with accounting.
For the measurement of their profit and the (x) material future, they need to note all of their transactions like (Buying, selling, consumptions, employees and workers, stocks and etc…).
For doing this proposes, they need to specify at least one or two large notebooks and utmost one person for each part, After each transaction, they note new note in the new row of their notebook, and calculate it at each accounting cycle, that it takes a lot of time for calculation and even some damages in correctness of their accounting. For example if they want to know how many and what kinds of materials do they have in their stock, they must to subtract or add the new imported or exported materials from/to the previous store account of the stock by the specification of (kinds and colors), that it can’t be done completely and fixed by using of one notebook and one people.
They believe that this situation and kind of accounting is good and can solve their problem currently but not very well, because in each calculation term, they must to spend a lot of time for their accounting and measuring of their profit and the more important point (taxes).
For solving of this problem, we decided to develop a special computer program that can help the industrial companies at their accounting and management aspects.
Our program will solve the points that were written in the proposal, and we are sure that it can solve all of their accounting and management problems, because we will design it completely by the needed viewpoints of the companies that we could catch by their interviews.
